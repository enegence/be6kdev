blur functions with buttons need to be able to envoke function with submit too (redundant site example)

No analog devices will be supported for this build, and no ATA devices are needed. // change wording

Note: to support SRST, the customer must have PSTN access to the router. // rephrase to PSTN connectivity 

*this is okay if there will be a mix of jabber-client-only devices

Number of vm boxes // set default value and see if we can make the box spaced better against the submit button

Enter total number of sites // change question to reflect "enter names below"

modal to explain geo-redundancy (hyper link)

add message on phone page stating that each phone type can be clicked for more information


analog and fax machine need submit button functionality and default values set to 0
analog and fax machine need same type of submit button

Are site name values current stored in vars?

redundant site name button needs to work on submit and not just blur
is this stored in var?



(note about georedundancy meaning servers at two physical locations, as opposed to a single head site)
